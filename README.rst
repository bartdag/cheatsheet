It seems I can never remember the subtleties of git reset, the difference
between markdown and restructuredText lists and the useful flags of the find
command. I always end up using duckduckgo or google to find these answers,
even though I know that (1) I used these commands before, (2) I probably wrote
down this information somewhere.

cs, the ultimate cheatsheet management bash script comes to the rescue. At
least, it came to my rescue.
